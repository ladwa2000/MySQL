# MySQL Learning Path: Documenting Growth and Proficiency #

## Introduction ##

This repository serves as a detailed log of my journey in learning MySQL, focusing on the development of practical SQL skills and a deep understanding of key concepts. I have documented various SQL queries and code examples, each accompanied by annotations that clarify important techniques and insights. The goal is to build a solid foundation in SQL for professional growth and to offer a valuable resource for others. This repository showcases my progress from beginner to proficient, with guidance from Alex the Analyst's Data Analyst Bootcamp, which is referenced throughout my queries and code examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgRwITQHszU&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=3.

### Beginner ### 

1. Alex the Analyst's Data Analyst Bootcamp provides a sample database which will be referenced in my queries and code examples.

2. Covering the fundamentals of SQL SELECT statements, demonstrating how to retrieve data from databases effectively. 

3. Delving into the use of WHERE clauses in SQL, demonstrating how to filter data based on specific conditions. It includes practical examples that utilise comparison operators, logical operators, and the LIKE operator to refine query results.

4. Exploring the use of GROUP BY statements in SQL, focusing on how to group data and apply aggregate functions such as COUNT, AVG, and others. Additionally, it covers the use of ORDER BY statements to sort data in ascending or descending order, along with best practices for efficient data organisation and analysis.
